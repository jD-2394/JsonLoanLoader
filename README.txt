NuGet packages needed to run the Json loading tool.
	-Newtonsoft.Json
	-MathNet.Numerics
	-Winforms (part of .NET)
The program uses .NET Framework 5.0

The JsonLoader includes User interface that allows the user to view the data without exporting (though that functionality is included also).
After opening the json, the dropdown specifying state / summary should appear. This will dynamically change depending on the state and summary data chosen.
The overall monthly summary data is shown on their own controls. The user has the ability to save both files to the results folder, or can select a location to save
either output file to a chosen location.
